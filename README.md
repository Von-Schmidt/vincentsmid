# Personal website - Svelte window manager prototype

This is a very WIP personal website, that I am building to use as a portfolio of sorts. Project is currently a barebones window manager with simple features. Taskbar is a TODO, alongside proper fullscreen window scaling. Every window will soon have a unique page inside, that will show off my projects I have been working on.

Built entirely in svelte.
